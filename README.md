Next Steps

**Data Preprocessing:**

Handle missing values and outliers in the Gross column.

Encode categorical variables (e.g., Genre, Certificate, Director).

Normalize numerical variables to improve model performance.

**Feature Engineering:**
Create new features such as average rating per director and genre popularity.

Extract relevant information from textual data (e.g., sentiment analysis on overviews).

Model Selection and Training:

Choose machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Train models using training data and evaluate using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**

Optimize models using techniques such as GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

**Model Evaluation:**

Compare models based on accuracy, RMSE, and feature importance.

Select the best-performing model for deployment.

**Deployment:**

Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI.

Create an API to receive input data and return predictions.

Host the model on cloud platforms such as AWS, Heroku, or Azure.
